# Semantic Versioning

>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
    
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
    
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes
    
- To allow a npm dependency to get updated to the latest PATCH-version, you can prefix the dependencyâ€™s version with the tilde-character (~)
    
- The caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well, tcdhe difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes
